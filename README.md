# Khalida Bestani - Machine Learning Course Portfolio

My name is Khalida Bestani and this repository is for my ITAI-1371 Machine Learning course.

### About Me
I'm studying machine learning because I find it very interesting how computers can learn from data and make predictions. I want to use these skills in my future career in technology or data science.

### Completed Work

#### Labs
- Lab 1: Introduction to Python for ML  
- Lab 2: Data Exploration and Visualization  
- Lab 3: Basic Machine Learning Models  

(More labs or assignments will be added later if needed.)
