# Lab 1: Basic Machine Learning Models

### What the Lab is About
This lab introduces fundamental machine learning concepts and essential Python libraries. It covers the end-to-end process of building a first predictive model, including:

Understanding ML terminology and workflow
Working with Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights
Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding, and scaling
Feature engineering and building a Logistic Regression classifier

By the end of this lab, students are familiar with the ML pipeline and can prepare data and train a basic model while interpreting results.
