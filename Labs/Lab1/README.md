# Lab 1: Basic Machine Learning Models

### What the Lab is About
This lab introduces fundamental machine learning concepts and essential Python libraries. It covers the end-to-end process of building a first predictive model, including:

Understanding ML terminology and workflow
Working with Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights
Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding, and scaling
Feature engineering and building a Logistic Regression classifier

By the end of this lab, students are familiar with the ML pipeline and can prepare data and train a basic model while interpreting results.
# Lab 1: Machine Learning Workflow and Types of Learning

### What I Did
This lab introduces fundamental machine learning concepts and essential Python libraries. It covers the end-to-end process of building a first predictive model.

### What I Learned

- Working with Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover insights
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding, and scaling
- Feature engineering and building a Logistic Regression classifier
- Key stages of the ML workflow (data collection, preparation, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment)
- Types of machine learning: supervised (e.g., regression and classification), unsupervised (e.g., clustering and dimensionality reduction), semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning
- How to choose the right type of learning based on the problem and data available

### Challenges
At first, it was a bit hard to remember the differences between supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning, and when to use each one—especially since this lab was mostly theory without coding examples. Drawing small diagrams and making a comparison table in my notes helped me understand and remember them much better.

The notebook `Lab1_KhalidaBestani_ITAI1371.ipynb` has all my notes and exercises.
