# Lab 3: Basic Machine Learning Models

### What the Lab is About
This lab introduces fundamental machine learning concepts and the end-to-end process of building a first predictive model. We worked with important Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) and practiced:

- Understanding ML terminology and the full workflow
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling)
- Feature engineering
- Training and evaluating models like Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and k-NN

### What I Did
I followed the full ML pipeline: loaded the dataset, explored the data, cleaned and prepared it, engineered some features, trained several models, and evaluated their performance.

### What I Learned
- The importance of splitting data into training and testing sets
- Different ways to measure model performance (accuracy, MSE, confusion matrix, etc.)
- How to preprocess data properly before training
- The basic steps of the machine learning workflow from start to finish

### Challenges
At first I made a mistake with the train-test split and got very low accuracy. After reviewing the code and the examples, I fixed it and the results improved a lot. Scaling the features also helped the models perform better.

The notebook `Lab3_KhalidaBestani_ITAI1371.ipynb` (or whatever the exact filename is) contains all my code, results, and comments..
