This lab emphasizes building and evaluating classification models in practice. Topics covered include:
- Implementing Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests  
- Comparing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC/AUC, and confusion matrices  
- Understanding model strengths, limitations, and interpretability  
- Applying proper evaluation techniques to select and refine models  

By completing this lab, students gain practical experience in training, evaluating, and interpreting classification models effectively.
