# Lab 3: Machine Learning Data Investigation

### What I Did
We investigated datasets in depth, performed feature engineering, analyzed correlations, and prepared data for modeling using various techniques.

### What I Learned
- Advanced data investigation methods (e.g., correlation analysis, feature scaling, encoding categorical variables)
- How to identify and handle issues like multicollinearity or imbalanced classes
- The role of exploratory data analysis (EDA) in improving model performance

### Challenges
Dealing with large datasets and deciding which features to keep or transform was challenging, but using tools like Pandas and Seaborn made it manageable after some practice.

The notebook `Lab3_KhalidaBestani_ITAI1371.ipynb` has all my work and analyses.
