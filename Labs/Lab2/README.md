# Lab 1: Machine Learning Workflow and Types of Learning

### What I Did
In this lab, we focused on understanding the complete machine learning workflow and the main types of machine learning. We went through the steps of a typical ML project (from getting the data to evaluating the final model) and discussed real-world examples of different learning approaches.

### What I Learned
- How to structure a machine learning project properly, including data acquisition, preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment
- The key differences between supervised and unsupervised learning
- Classification tasks (predicting categories) versus regression tasks (predicting continuous values)
- The importance of iterative development: training models, evaluating them, and improving step-by-step for better, reproducible, and interpretable results

### Challenges
At the beginning, it was a little hard to keep track of all the stages in the ML workflow and remember exactly when to use supervised versus unsupervised learning. Making a simple flowchart in my notebook and thinking about real examples (like predicting house prices for regression or spam detection for classification) really helped everything click into place.

The notebook `Lab1_KhalidaBestani_ITAI1371.ipynb` contains all my notes, examples, and exercises.
