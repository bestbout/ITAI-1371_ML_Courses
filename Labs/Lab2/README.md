# Lab 2: Machine Learning Workflow and Types of Learning

### What the Lab is About
This lab focuses on understanding the full machine learning workflow and the different types of learning. Key topics include:

- Structuring ML projects from data acquisition to model evaluation
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Classification and regression tasks
- Iterative steps for model development, training, and evaluation

We learned to apply the ML workflow systematically to real datasets and make our work reproducible and interpretable.

### What I Did
I followed the complete machine learning workflow on a real dataset: loaded the data, explored it, chose appropriate models (both classification and regression), trained them, evaluated the results, and made improvements where needed.

### What I Learned
- The difference between supervised and unsupervised learning
- How classification and regression problems are different and when to use each
- The importance of a clear, step-by-step workflow (data → preprocessing → model → evaluation → iteration)
- How to make my code and results reproducible (using random seeds, documenting steps, etc.)

### Challenges
At first I wasn’t sure when to use classification versus regression, but after seeing the examples and trying both on the dataset it became much clearer. I also forgot to set a random seed once and got slightly different results each time—I fixed it and now understand why reproducibility matters.

The notebook `Lab1_KhalidaBestani_ITAI1371.ipynb` (or whatever your exact filename is) contains all my code, results, and comments.
