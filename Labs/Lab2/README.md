This lab focuses on understanding the full machine learning workflow and the different types of learning. Key topics include:
- Structuring ML projects from data acquisition to model evaluation  
- Supervised vs. unsupervised learning  
- Classification and regression tasks  
- Iterative steps for model development, training, and evaluation  

Students learn to apply the ML workflow systematically to real datasets, ensuring reproducible and interpretable results.
